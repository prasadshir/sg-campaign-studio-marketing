# Steps to Certification

**Newcomer:** You are absolutely new to Drupal and Acquia products.

**Intermediate**: You have Drupal and Acquia Cloud development experience, but are new to Acquia Personalization.

**Advanced:** You have Drupal, Acquia Cloud, and Acquia Personalization development experience, and wish to get certified.

## Take Acquia Academy Product Introduction Courses

As a newcomer to the Acquia platform, take the introductory courses in Acquia Academy. This will start you on your journey to certification.

* Acquia Personalization Onboarding Overview
* Creating Personalized Experiences with Acquia Personalization
* Acquia Personalization Developer Kickstart
* Theming with Acquia Personalization

Acquia customers can access these and other courses for free by self-registering at [https://customers.acquiaacademy.com](https://customers.acquiaacademy.com). Once you have an account, you can log in at [https://www.acquiaacademy.com](https://www.acquiaacademy.com) and review them as many times as you like. Many Acquia Academy courses are available.

## Gain Practical Experience

Completing the courses alone will not prepare you to pass the certification exam. You need to have some real-life, practical experience to attempt the exam. For this purpose, we recommend that you gain practical experience by working on at least 2-3 projects utilizing Acquia Personalization.

## Perform Self Assessment

Once you decide to take the exam, we recommend that you study the [domains and topics](exam-domains.md) covered by the exam and their relative weights. You should also perform a [self assessment](self-assessment.md) of your own areas of strength and weakness vis-a-vis the domains and topics detailed in the exam blueprint. This is a recommended starting point for experienced Drupal 8 Developers.

## Use Labs and Study Guide

Based on your self assessment, you may need to gain knowledge and experience in some domains or topics. The best way to learn is by working or experimenting with the tools. Follow the suggestions given for preparation in the [Preparation](preparation.md) section and refer to the external resources given in the [Study Guide](study-guide.md) section.

## Appear for Exam

At this stage, you should be ready to take the exam! Follow the '**Schedule A Test**' link on [https://acquia.com/certification](https://acquia.com/certification) and register for the exam. You may choose from either online or onsite proctored exam delivery options.

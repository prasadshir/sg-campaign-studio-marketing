# Self Assessment

Experienced developers will likely know their weaknesses more than they know their strengths. You might have judged your own skill levels while reading through the exam domains listed above. It is quite natural for you to be more experienced and proficient in one domain than another. Also, within a domain, it is likely that you have hands-on experience with some topics but have never touched other areas within the same domain.

### How to Use Self Assessment

We suggest you perform a skills and expertise self-analysis with respect to the domains and topics listed in the blueprint. The blueprint lists test objectives \(topics\) for each domain. Rank your skills on a scale of 0 to 10 against each test objective \(0 for absolutely zero knowledge or exposure and 10 for complete mastery\).

* Topics with 8+ score are your strengths.
* Topics with a score of 5 to 7 will need some preparation.
* The ones below 5 may require a lot of preparation, or guided instruction.

You may use the following table to carry out your evaluation.
